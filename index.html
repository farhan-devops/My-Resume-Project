    <p>
        As a recent graduate with a strong foundation in web development, cloud computing, and DevOps principles, I am eager to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to a dynamic team. Proficient in front-end and back-end technologies, I have hands-on experience with languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and familiarity with frameworks like React and Node.js. Additionally, I possess foundational knowledge in cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, coupled with a solid understanding of DevOps practices for streamlined development and deployment processes.
